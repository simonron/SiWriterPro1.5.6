					<h1>SiWriter Instructions</h1>

SiWriter is a typing application. You keep your hand in the same place and just tap your fingers, SiWriter outputs a character when you type its coded pattern.  The patterns are created by selecting combinations of the five main finger pad keys. To help you remember the patterns, try and imagine the shape of the character you want to type and visualise it outlined in the five main keys.

 Have a look at the Cykey.co.uk site for further information.<BR><BR><br>
 
          Like the Cykey before it, the SiWriter reads the 'keys' or finger pad as they are pressed but only acts on the presses when the last one is released.<BR><BR>
 
          The images show the finger pad patterns for most of the codes available in SiWriter.  These may well be expanded to cover different language charactor sets, but existing codes will not be changed.<BR>

						<h2>Updates</h2>
The Pro version offers user control over the finger pad positions. Everyone has different sized hands and the iPad has a different sized screen to the iPad mini and there is no software way to tell them apart, so, we have to do that ourselves. Until now, I have not been able to type on my iPad mini because my hand is too large for the default setting created for the full sized iPad. Now though, by bringing up the new  'Alter pads position' panel from the slider switch on the Settings page, you have access to Twist, move left or right and up and down options as well as the facility to make the pad height and width greater or smaller. You can control the size of gap between them too. <br>
SiWriter will remember your settings until you wipe the app or press Reset. You can have different settings for portait and landscape mode.

<br><br>

The Pro version has been rewritten so that it is more responsive, faster and hopefully more intuitive. The full range of IOS text editing features is available by taping on the text area. 
<br><BR>
There are ‘shift’ keys to change key outputs to ‘Capitals’, ‘Numbers’ or ‘Symbols’.  By default, SiWriter is in lower case letter mode. To get an upper case letter, tap the Caps key once – an Orange dot shows - type a letter and it will be in caps, but the next letter will revert to lower case. Tapping twice will operate a Caps Lock, with a Green dot.  Tap that key once to clear Caps Lock. <BR><BR> 
 
Similarly, for Numbers, tap the lower horizontal Nums key once – and an Orange dot appears. Again, tapping twice will operate a Num lock, with a Green dot, and another tap will clear it.<BR><BR>
  
            For Symbols lock, either tap twice on both Shift keys, and get a light in both keys or use the specific newly added Symbols key.. To clear Symbols mode, tap either the Number or Caps buttons once. To get back to standard behaviour remove all the dots.<BR><BR>
   
        I have provided both a ‘schematic’ image and an ‘Actual keys to press' guide because some people find one or the other confusing to look at for some reason.
        <BR><BR>
       The selector switches have been moved from the Help page, leaving just this text.
